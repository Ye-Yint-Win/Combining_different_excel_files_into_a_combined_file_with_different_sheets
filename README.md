# Combining_different_excel_files_into_a_combined_file_with_different_sheets
I came up with a RMarkdown file for myself to combine different excel files into a combined file with different sheet names. You can use this to combine many xlsx into a single xlsx file and also cleaning the column data types.

I came up with this when scrapping Michael Jordan's data from Basketball Reference Website and I couldn't find anything that is combined. Therefore, I created this R code to combined 28 .xlsx files I downloaded from the website and created the output combined file with ordered sheet names and a bit of data types cleaning.
I couldn't include 28 files, but I have put 2 .xlsx files for this example case.
